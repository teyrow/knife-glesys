# Knife Glesys

knife-glesys is a Knife addon that will make it easier manage your VPS at [Glesys](http://www.glesys.se). You can create,
delete, list and show info about your servers.
To be able to use this addon you need to create a Glesys API key with permission to `IP` and `SERVER`. You do this in their control panel.

## Installation

To use the addon install it as a normal gem, from your command line run:

```bash
$ gem install knife-glesys
```

## Configuration

To configure the addon you can either add your Glesys username and your API key to knife.rb in your chef directory.

```ruby
knife[:glesys_username] = "YOUR USERNAME"
knife[:glesys_api_key]  = "YOUR API KEY"
```

Or you can pass your username and your API key to the knife glesys command.

```bash
$ knife glesys server list --glesys-api-key "YOUR API KEY" --glesys-username "YOUR USERNAME"
```

## Usage

### Create a new server

When creating a new instance you there are some options you need to supply for it to work, `image` (server template),
`platform`, `data-center`, `root-password` and a `hostname`. It is recommended that you also specify the number of
cpu cores, the amount of memory and disksize. Or else these will default to 1 cpu core, 512 mb memory and 10 gb disk.
If you want to view the options you can just run the command without any options.

```bash
$ knife glesys server create (options)
```

To create a OpenVZ Debian server in Stockholm you run this command (This will also provision the host with the `db` role):

```bash
$ knife glesys server create --image "Debian 6.0 64-bit" --platform "OpenVZ" --data-center "Stockholm" \
  --cpu-cores 1 --memory-size 128 --transfer 50 -N database --run-list 'role[:db]' \
  --hostname "data.example.com" --root-password 'passw0rd' --description "Redis database server"
```

#### Using configuration file

It may be more convenient to use `knife.rb` for more options. Something like

```ruby
knife[:glesys_username] = "YOUR USERNAME"
knife[:glesys_api_key]  = "YOUR API KEY"
 knife[:image] => 'Ubuntu 12.04 LTS 64-bit',
 knife[:datacenter] => 'Falkenberg',
 knife[:platform] => 'OpenVZ',
 knife[:memorysize] => 128,
 knife[:cpucores] => 1,
 knife[:description] => 'Redis database server',
 knife[:transfer] => 50,
 knife[:hostname] => 'data.example.com',
 knife[:disksize] => 10,
 knife[:rootpassword] => 'passw0rd'
 knife[:identity_file] => '~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub'
```

#### Configure password-less ssh

By passing option `--identity-file PUBLIC_KEY_PATH` the server is adding it to `~/.ssh/authorized_keys`.

### Support for knife-solo
Option `--no-bootstrap` just creates the server and tries to edit `nodes/SERVER_IP.json` if knife-solo exists. 
Install solo plugin with `gem install knife-solo`

### List available templates

Glesys offers many different templates (or images) to use when you spin up a new VPS. To get a list of all available and on which platform you run:

```bash
$ knife glesys templates list
```
      
### List your servers

To list your servers that you have connected to your account. This will give you a list with 

```bash
$ knife glesys server list
```

### More information about a server

To get detailed information about a server like how much memory that is used and how much the server costs you can issue the info command.

```bash
$ knife glesys server info vz31337
```

### Delete a server

Every server has a uniqe id at Glesys. Just pass this id to the delete command to erase the server.

```bash
$ knife glesys server delete vz31337
```

And to at the same time delete the Chef node pass the `--purge` option to the delete command.

## TODO

There are a few things that still needs to be fixed (in no special order).

* Manage Glesys IPs
* Graph server stats in console

## Known issues

* Needs HEAD version of [fog](https://github.com/fog/fog) to work
